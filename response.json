The clinic is quiet, tidy, and equipped with advanced equipment, including optical microscopes, for better resolution and clarity.\n\nThey helped my mom come up with a very detailed plan to treat a bunch of decayed teeth, a combination of tooth extraction, root canal treatment, and filling. Dr. Yang and Celia were very patient and spoke mandarin, which is great because my mom can’t speak English. Ultimately, they gave us a significant discount because my mom doesn’t have dental insurance. She is delighted with her experience here.\n\nA couple of years ago, I did a Michigan Splint Therapy at Dr. Yang’s clinic to help with my teeth-grinding issue, and it went well. Dr. Yang used a super cool 3D scanner to scan my teeth instead of a dental impression, and the result was good. The splint fits perfectly and is quite sturdy that I don’t see much wear up till now.\n\nI also want to thank Dr. Haidar for his professional job extracting my three wisdom teeth. One took a couple of tens of minutes because it was a horizontal tooth, and he had to break it apart first. For the rest, he only spent a few minutes on each, and I was good to go. The recovery went so well that no swelling occurred after the surgery (too bad I was kinda expecting the chipmunk selfie). After two weeks, I went for the follow-up visit, and we were all amazed at how well the recovery went considering I’m already in my mid-30s.

It was an amazing experience compared to what I've encountered with other dentists.\n\nThe cost is very reasonable too.
